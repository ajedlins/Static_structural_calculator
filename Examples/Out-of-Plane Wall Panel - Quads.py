# Quadrilateral elements have been pulled from the list of completed features. They are still
# available for use, but there is a known issue with them. They only seem to work properly when
# they are rectangular, or with nodes defined in a particular order and skewed in certain ways.
# After reviewing the derivation of the quad element multiple times, I can't seem to find the
# issue. I may resolve this issue in the future, but for now it's slowing down production of the
# rest of PyNite, so the feature is being sidelined to allow time for development of other
# features. Rectangular plates still work as expected to the best of my knowledge. Only
# quadrilaterals are affected.

# This is an example of a how quads can be used to create a wall panel for out-of-plane bending problems.
# A 'RectWall' class has been defined to automate the process of meshing, loading, and plotting results for a wall
# panel of any geometry and edge support conditions. At the bottom of this file (below the class
# definition) is a brief script showing how the 'RectWall' class can be been implemented, as well
# as a discussion of the nuances of quad elements the user should be aware of.

# MITC4 elements are very accurate, but there are some nuances to be aware of. They are described
# below.

# Render the wall. The default load combination 'Combo 1' will be displayed since we're not
# specifying otherwise. The quad mesh will be set to show 'Mx' results. It will be noted that the
# results are `unsmoothed` making the contour plot look "striped" like a step function. This will
# be discussed below in more detail.
import Visualization
Visualization.RenderModel(myWall.fem, text_height=meshsize/6, deformed_shape=False, combo_name='Combo 1', color_map='dz', render_loads=True)

# The `RectWall` class has a smoothing algorithm built into it. Let's plot a smoothed contour for
# Mx for comparison.
myWall.plot_forces('Mx')

# Essentially, smoothing averages the corner stresses from every quad framing into each node. This
# leads to a much more accurate solution. The unsmoothed plot is essentially showing quad center
# stresses at the quad element corners.

# Here are the expected results from Timoshenko's "Theory of Plates and Shells" Table 35, p. 202.
# Note that the deflection values for the PyNite solution are slightly larger, due to transverse
# shear deformations being accounted for.

print('Expected Mx at Center:', 0.0412*load*width**2)
print('Expected Mx at Edges:', -0.0829*load*width**2)
print('Expected My at Center:', 0.0158*load*width**2)
print('Expected My at Top & Bottom:', -0.0571*load*width**2)

# It should be noted that even the smoothed Mx contours are off by nearly 30% from the theoretical
# solution at the wall boundaries. Because there are no adjacent quads at the boundaries, PyNite
# cannot smooth the results there, and center stresses are being reported at the boundaries
# instead of corner stresses. So what's really going on here? Read on!

# MITC4 elements are very accurate, but the internal bending stress results at the corners are not.
# They are secondary values extrapolated from the derivatives of primary values. The corner bending
# stresses appear to more accurately represent the bending stresses at the center of the element.
# While corner STRESSES have this problem, the corner FORCES do not. To find the bending stresses
# at the quad nodes we'll get the moment at the corner and divide it by 1/2 of the plate width to
# convert it to a stress result. Note that when we talk about quad "stresses" we're really talking
# about forces per unit length of the element.

# With 200 quads in the model, quad 101 is on the left edge of the wall at mid-height, and carries
# the maximum moment.

# Get the force vector for quad 101
f_vector = myWall.fem.GetQuad('Q101').f()

# Although the MITC4 element nodes are defined by the user in the order [i, j, m, n], internally
# PyNite formulates the plate in the order [m, n, i, j] to be consistent with the literature used
# to derive this element. Therefore the MITC4 element's force vector is arranged as follows:
# ************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# f vector: [[fx_m, fy_m, fz_m, mx_m, my_m, mz_m, fx_n, fy_n, fz_n, mx_n, my_n, mz_n, fx_i, fy_i, fz_i, mx_i, my_i, mz_i, fx_j, fy_j, fz_j, mx_j, my_j, mz_j]]
# indices:  [[  0 ,   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   5 ,   6 ,   7 ,   8 ,   9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ]]
# ************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# nomenclature: fx_n = force in the local x-direction at the n-node
#               my_j = moment about the local y-axis at the j-node

# We are interested in the moment applied to the i-node about the quad's local y-axis (my_i). This
# is at index 16 in the f vector. Note that here Mx is the moment about the local y-axis, rather
# than about it's local x-axis. This can be confusing, but is a commonly used plate nomenclature.
Mx = f_vector[16, 0]

# We can find the max My moment similarly from quad 6
f_vector_11 = myWall.fem.GetQuad('Q6').f()
My = f_vector_11[15, 0]

# Now we'll convert these values to a force per unit length. The height and width of the plate is
# `meshsize`.
Mx = Mx/(meshsize/2)
My = My/(meshsize/2)

# Print the correct maximum bending moment:
print('Calculated maximum Mx (back-calculated from qaud nodal forces): ', Mx)
print('Calculated maximum My (back-calculated from qaud nodal forces): ', My)

# These values are much closer to the Timoshenko solution than the direct stress results. The Mx
# solution is within 1%, and the My solution is within about 6%. That is very good convergence for
# the 1'x1' mesh size. If the mesh size is reduced to 0.5' the My solution is within about 4% of
# the Timoshenko solution. It should also be remembered that even the Timoshenko solution is an
# estimate.
