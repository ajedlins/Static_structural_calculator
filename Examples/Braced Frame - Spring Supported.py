# gravity load. The gravity load forces the tension only spring to receive
# minor compression, which causes it to be deactivated on the first iteration.
# Once deactivated the model is unstable and an exception is thrown. This is
# normal and correct behavior. Load combination '1.4D' has been commented out,
# but you can uncomment it to see for yourself what happens.
